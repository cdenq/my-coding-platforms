# my-coding-platforms
`my-coding-platforms` is a comprehensive repo that contains solves for all of my coding platforms: HackerRank, NeetCode, LeetCode, and SQLPad.io.

I've have these different platforms because I wanted to try out their differences for myself. I eventually landed on using...
    - HackerRank for Data Science / AI / Math
    - NeetCode for SWE
    - SQLPad.io used less (replaced by HackerRank)
    - LeetCode used less (replaced by NeetCode)
